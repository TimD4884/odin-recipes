# odin-recipes

End of project reflection:

In this project I put my basic html knowledge to the test by making a simple recipe website.

It was great fun to finally utilise the knowledge I have gained from The Odin Project into something physical.

Lastly, I put my practice with Git to the test by making a commit everytime I made meaningful change to the website.

Thanks for reading.
