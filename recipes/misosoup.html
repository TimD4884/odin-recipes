        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup made with dashi (soup stock made with kombu or bonito flakes), miso paste and various ingredients depending on regional and seasonal recipes.</p>

            <p>While it is usually served together with a salad as part of an appetizer in the US, miso soup comes with rice as part of a main meal in Japan.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>One large onion</li>
                <li>Four cups of water</li>
                <li>One tablespoon of dashi granules</li>
                <li>Three-Four tablespoons of awase miso paste</li>
                <li>Ichimi togarashi (optional)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Put the sliced onions, water and dashi granule in a pot and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, cover and cook for 10-12 minutes, until the onions are tender.</li>
                <li>Place the miso paste in a small strainer and lower the strainer into the pot, until the liquid covers the miso paste. Stir the miso paste with chopsticks until it has fully dissolved.</li>
                <li>Turn the heat off and serve. Sprinkle a little ichimi for heat. Enjoy!</li>
