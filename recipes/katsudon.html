        <h2>Description</h2>
            
            <p>Katsudon is a popular Japanese dish consisting of tonkatsu (breaded deep-fried pork) and eggs cooked in a sweet and salty broth served over rice. Katsu, or "cutlet" in Japanese, refers to meat that's been pounded thin before being cooked. Don, or donburi, identifies this as a bowl dish.</p>

            <p>
                In Japanese culture, katsudon is considered soul foodâ€”the symbol of a tasty warm meal that can melt even the coldest part of your heart.
